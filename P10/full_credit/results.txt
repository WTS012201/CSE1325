QUESTION 1: Which puzzles did you use to achieve around a 30 second runtime: I used puzzles 10-69 

QUESTION 2: Provide the output of ``timeit`` (or ``time ./wssolver 1 puzzles/puzzle*.txt`` for runs with 1 through 16 threads below. You can run all of these with a single bash command if you like: ``for i in {1..16} ; do time ./wssolver $i puzzles/puzzles*.txt ; done``

Example Timing:

ricegf@antares:~/dev/202101/P10/baseline$ ./timeit

real  0m15.435s
user  0m15.395s
sys   0m0.028s

YOUR Timing:

time ./wssolver puzzles/puzzle1?.txt puzzles/puzzle2?.txt puzzles/puzzle3?.txt puzzles/puzzle4?.txt puzzles/puzzle5?.txt puzzles/puzzle6?.txt > output.txt

Using 1 thread: 
real    0m28.261s
user    0m28.118s
sys     0m0.084s

Using 2 threads: 

real    0m18.254s
user    0m28.517s
sys     0m0.880s

Using 4 threads: 

real    0m16.045s
user    0m28.673s
sys     0m0.726s

Using 8 threads:

real    0m15.818s
user    0m28.254s
sys     0m0.716s

Using 16 threads:

real    0m14.568s
user    0m28.346s
sys     0m0.168s

QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?

It continues to speed up the program, but the increase in speed becomes smaller. There appears to be a certain point where too many threads
can slow down the program slightly. This is probably due to how the program handles the puzzles in subsets for each thread.


QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?

Adding more threads appears to increase the "system load" because the cpu is having to manage more threads at once, increasing the
"system load" percentage.



BONUS
=====

QUESTION 5: Provide the output of ``timeit`` (or ``time ./wssolver 1 puzzles/puzzle*.txt``) for runs with (at least) 1, 2, and 4 threads below. 


YOUR Timing:




QUESTION 6: Does the thread pool approach you used in the Bonus section run substantially faster than the hard allocations use in the Full Credit section?

QUESTION 7: BRIEFLY summarize your strategies for optimizing the solution of word search puzzles.






QUESTION 8: In the performance competition, how would you like to be identified to the class? (Your real name is fine, or any professional alias is acceptable.)
